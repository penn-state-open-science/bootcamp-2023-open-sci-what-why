> Science is a deceptively inclusive word which refers to a variety of distinct though interrelated items. It is commonly used to denote (1) a set of **characteristic methods** by means of which knowledge is certified; (2) a **stock of accumulated knowledge** stemming from the application of these methods; (3) a **set of cultural values** and mores governing the activities termed scientific; or (4) any combination of the foregoing.

## Norms and counter-norms

![](img/mitroff-norms-counternorms.png)

---

| Norm | Counternorm |
|--------------|--------------|
| Faith in the *moral virtue of rationality* (Barber, 1952). | Faith in the *moral virtue of rationality and nonrationality* (cf., Tart, 1972). |
| *Emotional neutrality* as an instrumental condition for the achievement of rationality (Barber, 1952). |  *Emotional commitment* as an instrumental condition for the achievement of rationality. |

[@Mitroff1974-pp, p. 592]

---

| Norm | Counternorm |
|--------------|--------------|
| *Universalism*: "The acceptance or rejection of claims entering the list of science is not to depend on the personal or social attributes of their protagonist; his race, nationality, religion, class and personal qualities are as such irrelevant. | *Particularism*: "The acceptance or rejection of claims entering the list of science is to a large extent a function of who makes the claim" (Boguslaw, 1968:59). The social and psychological characteristics of the scientist are important factors influencing how his work will be judged. |

[@Mitroff1974-pp, p. 592]

---

| Norms | Counternorm |
|-------------|--------------|
| *Communism*: "Property rights are reduced to the absolute minimum of credit for priority of discovery" (Barber, 1952:130). "Secrecy is the antithesis' of this norm; full and open communication [of scientific results] its enactment" (Merton, 1949:611). | *Solitariness* (or, "Miserism" [Boguslaw, 1968:59]): Property rights are expanded to include protective control over the disposition of one's discoveries; secrecy thus becomes a necessary moral act (Mitroff, 1974b). |

---

| Norm | Counternorm |
|--------------|--------------|
| *Disinterestedness*: "Scientists are expected by their peers to achieve the self-interest they have in work--satisfaction and in prestige through serving the [scientific] community interest directly" (Barber, 1952:132). | *Interestedness*: Scientists are expected by their close colleagues to achieve the self-interest they have in work-satisfaction and in prestige through serving their special communities of interest, e.g., their invisible college (Boguslaw, 1968:59; Mitroff, 1974b) |

---

| Norm | Counternorm |
|--------------|--------------|
| *Organized scepticism*: "The scientist is obliged ...	to make public his criticisms of the work of others when he believes it to be in error ...	no scientist's contribution to knowledge can be accepted without careful scrutiny, and that the scientist must doubt his own findings as well as those of others" (Storer, 1966: 79). | *Organized dogmatism*: "Each scientist should make certain that previous work by others on which he bases his work is sufficiently identified so that others can be held responsible for inadequacies while any possible credit accrues to oneself" (Boguslaw, 1968:59). |

## Open science practices can...

- Help you
    - Realize your most idealistic aspirations
    - Find a realistic balance between self-serving and other-serving motivations
- Prevent you from "fooling yourself"

---

- Improve reproducibility
    - For you, your colleagues/collaborators, and others
- Enhance credibility
- Save time & money
    - Yours, colleagues/collaborators, taxpayers
- Improve scholarly rigor
- Accelerate discovery
