> Science is a deceptively inclusive word which refers to a variety of distinct though interrelated items. It is commonly used to denote (1) a set of characteristic methods by means of which knowledge is certified; (2) a stock of accumulated knowledge stemming from the application of these methods; (3) a set of cultural values and mores governing the activities termed scientific; or (4) any combination of the foregoing.

– (Merton, 1973), p. 268

> ..the idea that we all hope you have learned in studying science in school...It’s a kind of scientific integrity, a **principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty**—a kind of leaning over backwards.

:::

::::

## Principle 1: Don’t fool yourself

> The first principle is that **you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool**. So you have to be very careful about that. After you’ve not fooled yourself, it’s easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that.

## Principle 2: Show how you're maybe wrong

> I’m talking about a specific, extra type of integrity that is not lying, but **bending over backwards to show how you’re maybe wrong**, that you ought to do when acting as a scientist. And this is our responsibility as scientists, certainly to other scientists, and I think to laymen.

## Principle 3: Publish your results whichever way they come out

> One example of the principle is this: If you’ve made up your mind to test a theory, or you want to explain some idea, you should **always decide to publish it whichever way it comes out**. If we only publish results of a certain kind, we can make the argument look good. We must publish both kinds of result.

## Principle 4: Be transparent

> For example, if you’re doing an experiment, you should **report everything that you think might make it invalid—not only what you think is right about it**: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you’ve eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked—to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.

## Open science practices can...

- Help you realize your idealistic aspirations
- Prevent you from "fooling yourself"

---

- Improve reproducibility
    - For you, your colleagues/collaborators, and others
- Improve rigor
- Enhance credibility
- Save time & money
    - Yours, colleagues/collaborators, and others
- Accelerate discovery
